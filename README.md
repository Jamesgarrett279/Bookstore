# Bookstore
This program is a register/inventory system for a bookstore.

Mainmenu.cpp is the "main" file of this project, where all of the functionality resides.
It reads from/writes to the InventoryDatabase file which holds all of the information needed for the bookstore (book names, amounts, prices, etc.)
